# Structure
This repo structure is quite simple

`index.html` file contains the HTML structure of the app, which depends on Bootstrap

`js` folder contains:
* `jquery-3.1.1.min.js` file, which is the jQuery library
* `script.js` file that contains the custom jQuery code that implements the app features
